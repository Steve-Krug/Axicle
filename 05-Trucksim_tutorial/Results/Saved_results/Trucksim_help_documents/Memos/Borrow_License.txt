Borrowing a VS product license from a FlexLm Network Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

If your company has a VS product such as CarSim with a FlexLm network server,
you can "borrow" a license for use without a network connection, such as when
using a laptop computer at a remote location.

Following are instructions for CarSim. (Use the same method for TruckSim and
BikeSim, using corresponding folder names.)

From the client PC (i.e., your computer)

1. Open a DOS window and go to the Programs folder within the Prog folder for
   your software (e.g., <Prog folder> might be c:\CarSim810_Prog):
   <Prog folder>\Programs

2. Run this command to connect to the server and make the request:
   lmborrow MSCLIC dd-mmm-yyyy [hh:mm]

   where dd-mmm-yyyy is the expiration date (e.g., 05-aug-2011) and [hh:mm]
   is the optional expiration time 
              
3. Run the VS product again (e.g., CarSim.exe) to check out borrowed license.
   Then quit the VS product.

4. From the DOS window, check the license status by typing this command:
   lmborrow -status 
   
   You should see a response similar to this:
   
   lmborrow - Copyright (c) 1989-2003 by Macrovision Corporation. 
   All rights reserved. 
   
   Vendor     Feature                             Expiration 
   ______     ________                            __________ 
   MSCLIC     carsimus                            dd-mmm-yy hh:mm 
   
   It's done. You can now unplug the network cable and run your VS software.

5. To return the license for a feature to the network server early, plug the
   network cable back in, open a DOS window, and type:

   lmborrow -return <feature>
   
   where <feature> is the name of the feature, e.g., carsimus.
   
6. At any time you can check the license status on the server with the command:

   lmstat <feature>

   e.g., lmstat carsimus
